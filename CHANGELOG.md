19 Jun 2022

- **BC Break** Updated [neucore-plugin](https://github.com/tkhamez/neucore-plugin) to 0.8.0, all plugins
  must be updated, or they will stop working.
- **BC Break**: The `/core.alt` and `/core.managed-alt` login URLs have been removed. Use `core.default` and 
  `core.managed` respectively.

  someone logs in with a character from another account while already logged in.
- Added new reason for character deletion for admins: lost access.

ESI endpoint for apps:

  instead of the reason phrase.
- Added checks for ESI 429 errors (rate limit and throttled). If these have occurred and the wait time has not 
  yet expired, Core now returns a 429 error itself instead of making the ESI request.

- New: Membership in one group can now be made dependent on another group membership 
  (see documentation [Required Groups](doc/Documentation.md#required-groups).
- New: error limit for applications (only for esi endpoints).
- New: `removed-characters` endpoint for apps.
- BC-Break: DB migrations no longer add data, this is now done with Doctrine data fixtures. If you update 
  from a version lower than 0.7.0, you must manually add these new roles  to your existing applications 
  (if desired): `app-groups`, `app-chars`.
- BC-Break: "Player Groups Admin" is now called "Player Group Management" and requires the new role `user-manager`
  (instead of `user-admin`).
- BC-Break: Group applications revised, all existing applications are *deleted* with the update.
- BC-Break: The console command `make-admin` accepts now the Neucore player ID instead of the EVE character ID.
- Added player ID to account name everywhere.
- Added support for encrypted MySQL connection.
- Layout fixes.

  system settings. There is also a configurable delay for it.
- Optional EVE mail notification for disabled accounts.
- Character deletion: If a character has been transferred to another EVE account, it will be deleted or, 
  if detected during login, moved to a new player account. Biomassed characters (Doomheim) are now also 
  deleted automatically.
- Players can now also delete their characters manually, this must be enabled in the system settings.
- System settings: Some things can now be configured or activated/deactivated, needs the new role "settings".
